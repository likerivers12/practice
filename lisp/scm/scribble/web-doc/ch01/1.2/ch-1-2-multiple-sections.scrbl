@title{On the Cookie-Eating Habits of Mice}

If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.



@section{The Consequences of Milk}

That ``squeak'' was the mouse asking for milk. Let's
suppose that you give him some in a big glass.

He's a small mouse. The glass is too big---way too
big. So, he'll probably ask you for a straw. You might as
well give it to him.



@section{Not the Last Straw}

For now, to handle the milk moustache, it's enough to give
him a napkin. But it doesn't end there... oh, no.
